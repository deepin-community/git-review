    OpenSSH has deprecated its use of scp/rcp protocol in favor of
    SFTP, which the embedded Apache mina-sshd in widely-deployed
    Gerrit versions does not yet support. The default officially
    changed in OpenSSH 9.0 (some distributions, such as Fedora and
    CentOS, switched their default behavior to this as early as
    OpenSSH 8.7 or 8.8), leading to a ``subsystem request failed on
    channel 0`` error during commit-msg hook retrieval. Now
    git-review will attempt to detect whether scp's -O option is
    available to force use of the legacy scp/rcp protocol, and apply
    it if so. Future git-review versions may change the fallback
    behavior once an SFTP subsystem is implemented and available for
    a new Gerrit release.
