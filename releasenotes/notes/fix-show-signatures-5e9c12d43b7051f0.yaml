fixes:
  - |
    Git's log.ShowSignature option is now supported. Previously,
    setting it would confuse git-review into thinking there were
    twice as many changes to push.
upgrade:
  - |
    Git 2.10.0 or later is required as git-review now needs the
    ``--no-show-signature`` option for git-log.
