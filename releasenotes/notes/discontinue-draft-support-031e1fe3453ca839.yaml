    Not really a deprecation so much as a removal, Gerrit 2.15 (released in
    2017) ceased providing a draft state for changes, and many large sites were
    disabling support for it far earlier than that. As of now, git-review has
    removed the ``-D`` and ``--draft`` options entirely, and so can no longer
    push draft changes on old Gerrit deployments which still allowed them.
