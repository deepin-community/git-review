    Support for auto-configuration of topic names based on the presence of
    keywords in the commit message is removed. Previously, keywords such as
    ``bug``, ``bp`` or ``lp`` followed by a number would result in branch
    names containing the associated number, e.g. ``bug/123``. This feature
    was OpenStack specific, was a frequent source of bugs and clearly wasn't
    being used that often, given that StoryBoard is a thing now and no one had
    updated this feature to handle that metadata.
