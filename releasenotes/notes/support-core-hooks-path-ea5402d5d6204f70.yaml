    git-review now handles the Git ``core.hooksPath`` configuration
    option correctly. Thus, it installs the ``commit-msg`` hook into
    the ``core.hooksPath`` directory, if that option is
    set. Otherwise, it continues to install the hook into
    ``.git/hooks``, relative to the root of the checkout.
