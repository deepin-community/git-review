features:
  - |
    Patch download now supports change urls. Rather than forcing users to copy
    only part of a URL to a review, users may now paste the whole change URL.
fixes:
  - |
    Fix git review -d M,N for newer gerrit. The "number" field returned via
    gerrit JSON can be a string (2.13) or a integer (~2.14).
  - |
    Update default gerrit namespace for newer gerrit. According to Gerrit
    documentation for 2.15.3, refs/for/'branch' should be used when pushing
    changes to Gerrit instead of refs/publish/'branch'.
upgrade:
  - |
    The ``-c`` and ``--compatible`` command line options have been removed.
    They had been there so someone could request compatibility with older
    Gerrits, but the need for this has gone away.
