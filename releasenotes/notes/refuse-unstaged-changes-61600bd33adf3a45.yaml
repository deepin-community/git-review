    For safety, attempts to push a commit with unstaged or uncommitted changes
    in the worktree will be caught and an error reported, rather than leaving
    it up to ``git rebase`` to spot them. This addresses a situation where
    users enabling *rebase.autostash* would otherwise experience data loss when
    the test rebase is subsequently reset.
