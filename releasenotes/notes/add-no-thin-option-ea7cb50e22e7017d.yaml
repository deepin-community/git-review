    Add support for --no-thin which is passed to git push. This is useful to
    work around situations where Gerrit's JGit and git-review's C git
    implementations cannot agree on the pack file contents used to transfer
    a push. When they disagree you see this as unpack failures due to missing
    trees. Using --no-thin avoids complicated negotiations and works around
    this problem.
