    As of this release, git-review no longer supports running under the Python
    2.7 interpreter. The major version component has been increased
    accordingly. Users wishing to use git-review with Python 2.7 can cap their
    installations like ``pip install "git-review<2"``, though pip version 9 and
    later will use python_requires package metadata to avoid installing
    git-review on an unsupported interpreter. Future removal of support for
    Python 3 minor versions will only result in a minor version increase for
    corresponding git-review releases.
